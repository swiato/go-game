# 🧠 Go Game

This repository hosts a **very early gameplay prototype** for the **Go match system with AI opponent**, built in the **Godot game engine**.
It is one of the key gameplay modules for a larger **Go-based adventure game** and aims to combine classic Go strategy with modern, game-like presentation and personality-driven AI opponents.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

This prototype explores the mechanics of **playing Go against an AI** opponent in a **character-driven**, stylized setting.
It blends traditional Go gameplay with interactive elements inspired by games like **Puzzle Quest**, adding:

* Dynamic **visual effects**
* **NPC personality systems**
* Dialogue-driven emotional interactions
* Context-aware **AI behavior** and in-game reactions

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

### ✅ Current Capabilities

* ✔️ Full Go game logic implementation
* ✔️ AI opponent powered by a **convolutional neural network**, trained on real game data
* ✔️ Built entirely in **Godot Engine**
* ✔️ Functional match flow (game start, turns, end)

> ⚠️ AI is trained on limited hardware — not superhuman, but **entertaining enough for early prototyping**

## 🌟 Planned Gameplay Mechanics

### 🧩 Puzzle Quest–Inspired FX

* Visual and sound effects triggered by:

  * Good moves (e.g. flashy visual burst or glow)
  * Blunders or bad moves (e.g. screen shake or dark cloud)

### 🧠 Personality-Based AI

* AI opponents will reflect their **character traits**:

  * A **cocky rival** might taunt the player after mistakes
  * A **shy or respectful opponent** might admire a strong move
* Each AI's **confidence and emotions** will be shown via:

  * **Facial expressions** on their avatar
  * **Dialogue box** responses triggered during the match

### 🗨️ In-Match Dialogue System

* Dialogue mechanics integrated into the Go board view
* Reactions to player performance based on:

  * Mistakes
  * Good moves
  * Game state shifts (e.g. AI realizes it’s losing)
* Enhances immersion and storytelling during matches

### 💡 Hint System

* Optional mechanic to:

  * Suggest a few **potential good moves**
  * Help beginners learn decision-making without explicit backseat play

### 📚 Pattern Recognition & Technique FX

* Detection of known Go patterns or tactics (e.g. tesuji, ladder)
* Trigger **unique visual or textual effects** to:

  * Reward pattern usage
  * Highlight skill and reinforce learning
